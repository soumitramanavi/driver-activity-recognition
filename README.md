# driver-activity-recognition

The MobileNetV3Large integrated with Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM) uses State Farm Dataset to train and evaluate on different driver activities. This is a multi-class classification research conducted under limited training parameters.

Similarly, the EfficientNetB3 model is also used to train and evaluate on the State Farm Dataset.

We conduct analysis on both the light weight models and analyse the dataset ambiguity to differentiate few driver activites.

CBAM_MobileNetV3Large.ipynb and CBAM_EfficientNetB3.ipynb are the files where experiments are conducted for State Farm Dataset.
